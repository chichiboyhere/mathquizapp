# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

"# mathquizapp" 
Bloomer's math quiz app is an app particularly aimed at helping students sharpen their mathematical skills. Its targeted audience is for pupils/students ranging from 5 - 17 years. But outliers are also welcome to play. It has three sections: Multiplication Game, Arithmetic Game and Cool Calculators. The Multiplication Game, as the name implies, tests the student's multiplication ability. First, the student is prompted to enter a multiplication table limit, minimum of which is 2. And on clicking "Start Game", the student gets a flash of multiplication problems involving two numbers the first of which stays within the limit chosen. (ie. the first number is from the table limit chosen and 2. So for example if the student chose 4, they are tested with multiplication problem from 4 to 2). Also it is worth noting that the second number ranges from 2 - 12.

The Arithmetic Game is a superset to the Multiplication Game as it involves not only multiplication problems but also addition, subtraction and division. It has three difficulty levels: Basic, Moderate and Challenging.

Both games give the user a chance to choose a playing time between 1 minute and 5 minutes.

The Cool Calculators(not implemented as at the first git commit of this app) has some useful calculators like Measures of Central Tendency, Quadratic Equation, Simple Interest, Compound Interest calculators and so on.

In its finished state, the app should offer users the ability to save their top scores and compare them against the global top score.

The entire app is coded in React Js(at the first commit) and the other MERN stack components (when fully implemented.)
